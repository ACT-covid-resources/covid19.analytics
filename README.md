# COVID19

## Introduction
The covid19 package allows users to obtain live data from the
novel Coronavirus COVID-19 as published by the JHU CCSE repository [1].

The `covid19()` function can obtain data from the JHU's CCSE repository,
aggregating the data in different categories "confirmed"/"deaths"/"recovered"
cases reported daily per country/region/city.
